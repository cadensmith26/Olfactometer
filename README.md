# Olfactometer
This LabVIEW Code is for an 8-channel olfactometer and data acquisition device/oscilliscope. 

The main file is the one titled "ODOR_BLASTER_V22.3 Final"
This was made in LabVIEW version 22.3

Olfactometer was made using resources acquired from a paper by Burton et al. (2019) titled "A Novel Olfactometer for Efficient
and Flexible Odorant Delivery"

This code was made to be simple and user friendly for non-complex and less expensive set ups.
- It was made into a 8 channel olfactometer rather than the published 12 channels.
- This was made for use with a simple amplifier without a trigger. A trigger could easily be added to have more accurate
 recording at the time of stimulus delivery.
- This was also made so that the DAQ used (DAQ6001) can also record data at a sample rate of 10,000 samples per second.
-   A different DAQ could be used to get higher sampling rates or a proper electrophysiology sampler could be used.
